== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the plug-in? =

Easy: Add the shortcode [toc] to your post or page, where you want the TOC box to appear. To align the TOC box to the left or right, use [toc class=toc-left] or [toc class=toc-right].

= Why are there no options? =

Most customization is related to CSS anyway. However, I plan to add some options in future versions.

= I love your work, are you available for hire? =

Yes I am. [Contact me](http://hackadelic.com/contact) to "talk turkey" :)
